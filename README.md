# astrology-project
We are developing webpage that displays horoscope data and allows users to find their horoscope quote and GIF based on the sign and their preferred timeframe. This website was designed so that we could better help an individual find a horoscope and a related GIF. It gave us a chance to work on multiple API's in the same project and develop a project that we are proud of. The link to the deployed page is:  https://hstephan23.github.io/astrology-project/ 

This webpage uses local storage to keep track of the previously displayed GIF's and display them again if the user wants to see them. 

We learned many new tools. The first was how to use modals from a framework, the second was how to better use a fetch function, the third being sorting code so it looks nicer through functions, and finally beind able to use documentation to understand how API's and frameworks work. 

## API's
The API's are taken from:
https://horoscope-app-api.vercel.app/api/v1/get-horoscope/
https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/
To get the CORS working for all computers, we used the following start to our URL for the horoscope API:
https://corsproxy.io/

## Usage:
The website is simply used through inputing the sign you want, the timeframe, and pressing the "go" button. This allows for the website to use API's to pull the correct data for the related GIF and the horoscope quote.
